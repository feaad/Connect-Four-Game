        The function checks if two objects of the AlgorithmType class are equal
        by comparing their values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : object
            The "other" parameter is an object that we are comparing to the
            current object for equality.

        Returns
        -------
            The `__eq__` method is returning `True` if the `other` object is an
            instance of the `AlgorithmType` class and has the same `value`
            attribute as the current object (`self`). Otherwise, it returns
            `False`.
